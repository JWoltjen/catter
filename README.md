# Learning Redux Toolkit with Catter!

Catter is a very basic SPA that was built to showcase the power of state management with React-Redux and ReduxToolkit. 

## What's this App do? 

Catter makes a call to third-party API which fetches 10 cats, adds an upvote property, and maps the new cat objects onto a higher order component, CatList. Once rendered, with the help of createSlice() and Redux Toolkit, users can upvote images of cats they like, reset the number of upvotes on a single cat, or reset the total number of upvotes being rendered. State does not persist on reload since there is no backend. 

## Cats as a Service API

This demo takes advantage of [Cats as a Service API](https://cataas.com/) created by @kevinbalicot . 

## How does CreateSlice() work? 

## How is data fetched from the API?
